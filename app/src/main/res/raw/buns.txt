### **Dough (makes 10 buns)**

- 300 g [~2 1/2 cups] all-purpose (plain) flour see notes below if using cups
- 175 ml [3/4 cup] hot boiling water
- a pinch of salt

### **Filling and Seasoning**

- 1/2 lb [250g] green beans chopped
- 14 oz [397g] firm tofu pressed and mashed
- 1 small carrot finely chopped
- a handful of chopped cilantro
- 3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon salt adjust accordingly
- 1 teaspoon white pepper

### **Other**

- oil for cooking
- sesame seeds
- a handful of chopped green onions


### **Instructions**
### **Dough**

- To make the bun wrapper, place flour and salt into a large bowl and mix until well combined.
- Make a well in the middle and pour in the hot water. Using a spatula, fold in all the flour until a shaggy dough forms with no dry spots of flour in the bowl (if there is, add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time).
- Transfer the dough onto a cleaned surface and knead into a dough, about 10-12 minutes. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 mins.

### **Filling**

- Meanwhile, place tofu in a nutmilk bag and wring out all the liquid.
- In a heated non-stick pan with 2 teaspoons of oil, sauté chopped green beans for about 2 minutes or until green beans turn to a darker green.
- Place cooked green beans into a bowl along with the tofu, carrot, and seasoning ingredients.
- Mix all ingredients until well combined and divide the mixture into 10 portions. Using your both of your palms, form it into a patty-like shape.

### **Assemble**

- When the dough is ready, dust flour on the surface and roll the dough out into a log, and then divide into 10 equal portions.
- To assemble, take one dough and flatten it with your palm.
- Hold the wrapper with your non-dominant hand and a roller with your dominant hand. Roll the dough by pushing from the outside towards the middle of the wrapper.
- Twist and turn your wrapper while doing this (with your non-dominant hand). Roll it into a 4.5 inches diameter disc. With this rolling method, the middle of the wrapper is thicker which creates a good safety net for the filling.
- Place one filling patty in the middle and pleat to seal.
- Dab the smooth side with water and gently press on some sesame seeds. Continue with the rest of the ingredients.

### **Cook the buns – Potsticker style**

- To cook the buns, heat a non-stick pan (used 12") with a tablespoon of oil.
- Gently flatten each bun with your palms and place them in the pan, sesame side down, slightly apart. Fit as many as you can in one layer.
- Cook until the bottom turns golden brown, then flip the buns and add 1 to 1.5 cups [250g-375g] of water (be sure the water covers > than ⅓th of the bun's height).
- Cover the pan with a lid, preferably glass and turn heat to low-medium. Cook until all water has completely evaporated, about 5 to 10 minutes.

### **Cook the buns in an oven**

- Alternatively, preheat oven to 375F (195°C) and brush the buns with oil.
- Bake the buns for about 20-25 mins or until golden brown, flipping in between.
