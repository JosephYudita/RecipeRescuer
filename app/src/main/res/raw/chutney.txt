### **Ingredients**
- 1 ripe mango peeled and sliced (see notes)
- 1 medium size shallot (peeled and sliced) or ½ cup diced red onion
- ⅓ – ½ cup coconut sugar or raw sugar (adjust to desired sweetness)
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1–2 Tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1 jalapeño (chopped) – remove seeds if you prefer less spicy.
- 1 teaspoon of kosher salt
- Pinch of cayenne
- **optional** 2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger or ¼ teaspoon of ground ginger
- Cilantro to garnish (optional)


### **Instructions**
1. Prep the produce – peel and slice mango, shallot; and slice the jalapeño, removing seeds if you desire less spice. Place in a small pot.
2. Place remaining ingredients (minus cilantro) in the pot. Cook on medium to medium high heat (stirring occasionally) until mango and jalapeños soften. The mangos will start to brown around 15-20 minutes. The sugar will be dissolved and liquid should be reduced some what.
3. Remove from stove and place all ingredients in a food processor or blender.
4. Pulse a few times until ingredients are mixed, but still thick.
5. If serving right away, spoon into a bowl and garnish with cilantro (if desired).
6. If you’d like to save the chutney for later, spoon into a glass container, and cover with lid. A small mason jar works great!
7. Store chutney in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 10 – 12 days. Makes about 1 cup depending on the size of mango used.
8. Ways to use chutney – on grilled fish or chicken. Great with burgers! Or even as a dip mixed with yogurt.
9. Add extra salt and pepper, if desired.
