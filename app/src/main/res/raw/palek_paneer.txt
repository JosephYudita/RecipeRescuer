### **Instructions**

- **Preparing The Spinach**: Always use fresh spinach and completely avoid using matured spinach as it can spoil the taste of the whole preparation. Avoid using the stalk as well.
- I like to use baby spinach for Palak Paneer preparation. Rinse them properly under running water and keep them in a bowl with lukewarm water and a bit of salt for 15 minutes or so to get rid of the pesticides. Get rid of the water and again rinse them under running water.
- **Blanch the Spinach**: Prepare a pot of water to a boiling point. Add the chopped spinach leaves and blanch for 2 minutes. Add about 1/2 tsp of salt to it.Drain and immediately transfer the spinach to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process, keeping that vibrant green color. Drain again and set aside.
- Before setting it aside make sure you get rid of the water from the spinach properly, use a strainer, and later on squeeze them to get rid of the excess water in them.
- **Prepare the Paneer**: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the paneer cubes and lightly fry them until light golden on all sides. Take them out and put them aside. This golden crust adds a lovely texture.
- I personally love the paneer cubes to be moderately fried until they attain a golden brown color but many prefer the paneer to be lightly fried or not fried at all, especially in palak paneer preparation. That is a matter of personal preference.
- But make sure you do not fry them too much otherwise the spices and flavors will find it hard to penetrate deep inside of them.
- **Make the Onion, Chili, Ginger, and Garlic Mixture**: In another pan, add the second tablespoon of oil. Add 1 tsp cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
- Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chilies. Sauté for another minute. This is where the kitchen starts to smell wonderful.
- **Add the Tomatoe**s: Add your de-seeded chopped tomatoes next, cooking them down till they’re soft and meld into a mushy mix. This creates a rich, tangy foundation. Add in salt as per your taste (around 1/2 tsp).
- **Blend the Ingredients and add the cashew**s: Transfer the cooked onion-tomato mixture to a blender along with the blanched spinach. Add about half a cup of cashew nuts for a creamy texture and to reduce the all-over bitter taste of the spinach.
- Blend until smooth to form a vibrant green puree. Aim for a smooth, vibrant green puree. This is the heart of our dish.
- **Add in the spices**: Pour this green magic back into the pan. Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt to taste. Cook the mixture for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, and watch as the colors deepen.
- **Add the Paneer**: Gently add the fried paneer cubes to the spinach mixture. Stir well to coat the paneer evenly with the palak gravy, letting it soak up all those flavors.
- **Simmer and Serve**: Let the Palak Paneer simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. This is where the magic happens, and all the flavors become friends.
- **Garnish and Serve**: Sprinkle with fresh cilantro leaves. It adds a pop of color and freshness right before you serve. You can use a drizzle of cream as well along with chopped lemon pieces to give it a colorful look.
