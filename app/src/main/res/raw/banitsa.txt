### **Ingredients**
-1 cup butter, (equivalent to 2 sticks), melted, plus more for the baking dish
- 454 grams Phyllo dough (frozen), (1 package, about 16 sheets; aka 16 ounces total)
- 5 eggs
- 350 grams Bulgarian white cheese, Sirene or any feta
- 1.5 cups plain yogurt, Balkan-Style or any you like
- ½ teaspoon baking soda

### **Instructions**
Line a 12-inch round baking dish with parchment paper and lightly grease with melted butter. Preheat the oven to 400F.

- Thaw the phyllo sheets as per the package directions and meanwhile, start preparing the ingredients before you unroll the thawed phyllo.
- In a large bowl, break the feta into chunks using a fork. Add the eggs and mix well with the fork. Add the yogurt and baking soda and mix well.
- Unroll the thawed phyllo sheets and cover with a clean kitchen towel or a slightly damp towel as they dry quickly. Place one sheet on your work surface and brush with some of the melted butter. Place another sheet on top of the first sheet and butter it as well. Add a few big spoonfuls of the yogurt-feta mixture onto the top phyllo sheet and spread it around. You should have a thin layer of the yogurt-feta mixture.
- Tightly roll up the phyllo sheet lengthwise to form a long rope. Roll that "rope" into a spiral and place it in the center of your baking dish. Repeat this process with the remaining phyllo sheets and yogurt-feta mixture and wrap each stuffed "rope" around the center to create a coiled pattern, until the baking dish is full. (Since there are 16 phyllo sheets in a pack and we use 2 sheets per roll, you should have a total of 8 ropes that are filled with the feta-yogurt mixture.)
- NOTE: Please watch my video below for a helpful visual on how to make this dish. You can also place the phyllo rolls side by side lengthwise in a baking dish instead of rolling them around one another, if that’s easier.
- • Lightly brush the top of the Banitsa with melted butter and bake until flakey and golden, 45 to 50 minutes depending on the oven. It should be nice and light and golden on the top and bottom. I bake mine uncovered on the middle rack. Let it cool a bit and enjoy.
